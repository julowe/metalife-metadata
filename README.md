Get metadata from R2R about a person's expeditions - for now some measure of days at sea and miles sailed. (Days at sea is likely complicated by variation on what days are marked as Departure and Arrival. e.g. Did we actually depart on that day, or is that when the work for the cruise started? Or was there a maintenance delay? etc.)

“Some years ago — never mind how long precisely — having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off — then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.” ― Herman Melville, Moby Dick
