# Tests

## Test Data

For now this directory only has test data files.

[NA104](https://www.rvdata.us/search/cruise/NA104) was around the Channel Islands.
The cruise track is convoluted.

[NA132](https://www.rvdata.us/search/cruise/NA132) was from Los Angeles to Honolulu.
The cruise track is mostly direct/straight.
One quick very dumb calculation gives that distance as
~2500 miles, 4100km, 2200 nautical miles.

I have only uploaded the 1 minute resolution data and the control points files
for these cruises.
The `_full` and `full_qc` files are around 70MB each.
They can be retrieved from the above R2R links if needed.
